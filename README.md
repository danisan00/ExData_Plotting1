## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to the Course Project 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis course in Coursera.
See https://www.coursera.org/course/exdata

The repository contains 4 R scripts plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R which implement the required functionality:

1.  Load <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> data from <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository</a>. The file is assumed to be previously downloaded and extracted to the working folder.
2.  Generate plots and store them as PNG files (see details below).

The repository also contains the output of running the aforementioned 4 R scripts: 4 PNG files named plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png.

For the script to work, the following input file is needed path is relative to R working folder):
* household_power_consumption.txt

## The plots

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to
reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed
using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)


For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
include the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.


The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below. 


### Plot 1

### Plot 2

### Plot 3
